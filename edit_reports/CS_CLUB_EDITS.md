# CS club Nov 20th debug meeting 

- Lets go over the list of all the errors from the meeting 

## Vulnerabilities 

### infinite rate, no limits 

- David posted like 400 posts to the server and posts, need to have limits on number of uploads per minute, maybe just one upload? 

### File upload

- Added filter and fixed this already

### Moderation (admins) 

- Need a report button on posts like a flag, need an admin panel + transferability 


## Suggestions and Bugs 

### Check mark darker 

- This is during the verification of presidency, needs have the border on it

### join text is white on white? 

- Not an actual issue since the button has no function

### internal way to assign club leadership from higher ups, or to transfer ownership

- I think Sam's idea here is that it currently relies on the good will of people to accomplish this. 
- Needs a process for club mentors to approve the claiming of the club, 
- Guessing that this needs an option for the club sponsor to have controls over leadership appointment.
